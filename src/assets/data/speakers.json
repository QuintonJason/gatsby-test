To be a great developer you must also think like a designer. Not in terms of colors and fonts, but in terms of empathy. You must understanding how users interact with your product and how their interactions shape the way you build. User Experience (UX) Design is a fundamental tool in a great developer's toolkit.",

Designers lob something over the wall for development without knowledge or perspective of technical limitations, and developers are left to sort out requirements and edge cases. No one is satisfied when designers' visions aren't implemented or developers are expected to explain why something can't be built. It doesn't have to be this way. This talk will introduce solutions you can implement on your team to bridge the divide and do your best work. Using an internal project at Rackspace as a case study, Glynnis will talk about why upfront planning, identifying the problem before agreeing on a solution, and cross-disciplinary collaboration are crucial to successful projects.",

I will briefly show some examples of things built using p5 and its add-on libraries.",
